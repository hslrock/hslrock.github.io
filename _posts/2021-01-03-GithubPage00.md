## Create a Github Page

We will skip creating Github page tutorial and installing Jekyll theme as there are already many available contents in Google

I am going to use <a> https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll </a> for the tutorial.

Please follow the instructions on the above Github repository for installation

Below shows the preview of the vanilla page

## Starting with basic Initialization




The first thing you will do is change the name of the blog or change the image and delete some pseudo-posts

Former is simple, you just delete files under _posts tab and change the contents in config.yml.

Next, I deleted some of the contents in _layout/home.html, and changed background img

<p align="center">
<img align="center" height=400 src="{{page.imgLink}}/home_html.png">
</p>

Now my main page looks like this:


<p align="center">
<img align="center" height=400 src="{{page.imgLink}}/start.png">
</p>

 I am planning to put my own feature into the main page later.

## Adding additional Link

I would like to add additional content at top bar that links to my Github.

Under _includes, there is a file named "navbar".html

<img align="center" height=400 src="{{page.imgLink}}/navbar_.png">

Add  
```

<li class="nav-item">
<a class="nav-link" href="https://github.com/hslrock">Github</a>
</li>

```
in amy position. The result will be:

<img align="center" height=50 src="{{page.imgLink}}/navbar.png">

Next we will discuss the organizing the posts into different categories
